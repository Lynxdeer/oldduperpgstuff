# DupeRPG stuff
This is A repository of everything I have backed up when duperpg was still around.

Feel free to take anything and make your own server, cause I honestly couldn't care less. Note that most of these scripts are very poorly optimised and are probably extremely buggy, so be warned if you're actually gonna use these.
If I ever decide to make a dupe server again, I'm definitely gonna optimise it a lot more than this, and also not use skript.
